Name: Sujatha Gopi

This project is to become familiar with the environment in hoare using system calls. I have used perror and getopt in this submission. This project
will create an executable to perform a breadth first traversal of the directories using a queue and will print the file properties as requested


Steps to compile and run:

1. To compile : Type "make" in the directory where the project files and Makefile is present.

2. I have 3 separate file bt.h, bfs.c and bt.c for this project. So either can type "make" or "make ALL"
3. This will generate bt.o bfs.o and bt executable file
4. To execute: Type ./bt [dirname]  (or) ./bt  (or) .bt -dpig [dirname]
5. To see more options supported use: ./bt -h

6. Few examples:

	a) ./bt -dst [dirname] -> Shows last modification, filesize and type of directory and files.

	b) ./bt -L -> Follows symbolic link 
7. Version control : I have used git for version control. use "git log" to see git commit timeline. 
I will keep the version control log file in the same folder with name "git log" 

Any known issues: Null
