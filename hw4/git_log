    1. Added code for blocked queue in oss.c
    2. Added output log details
    3. Added code for blocked and preempted functionality in oss.c
    4. Added code for signal handler for CTRL+C and cleanup code
    5. Changed PCB data structure in oss.h to reflect timing and new function to add item in the head of the queue
    6. Added code in binary.c for calculating all timing for process and update shared memory

    1. Modified PCB data structure in oss.h
    2. Added code to calculate burst time, wait time and run time in binary.c
    3. Added code for message queue communication between oss and binary
    4. Changed oss.c to reflect choice of binary and calculate timing as decided by binary
